# Anoma Intent Centric Prototype

I built this site to show how the intent-centric approach can simplify everyday Web3 experiences. It is not connected to a live network, there are no wallets or live transactions. My goal was to demonstrate that the user only needs to say “what they want to do” and let the system imagine the rest.

▫️ Intro section: I added a headline and a “Watch AnomaPay Introduction” button. From here you can watch the AnomaPay introduction video.
▫️ The Intents section: Here I explained the purpose of the prototype. In other words, I highlighted how the process can be simplified with a single intent instead of step-by-step actions.
▫️ Cards:
- Define the Intent: The user specifies their goal.
- Design the Solver: I show how this goal could be solved.

Show the Flow: I present the flow of the process from start to finish in a simple way.
▫️ Intent-Centric Flow: I explained in bullet points how an intent is created, discovered, matched, and settled. This way, the user clearly sees the steps intent → discovery → solution → result.
▫️ Cast Your Intent section: Here I offered users options like “Token swap,” “Yield farming,” and “NFT trade.” They can select source chain, destination chain, amount, and token. When they click “Cast Intent Spell,” the intent appears in the preview screen.
▫️ Intent Preview: In this part I show a small visual flow of how the intent is processed: Intent Declared → Anoma Processes → Intent Fulfilled.
▫️ Community section: With the message “Let’s build for Anoma” I emphasized the community aspect. I also added links to X, the website, and Discord.

With this demo, I wanted to give people the message: “think about the outcome, not the steps.”
